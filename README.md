## Installation (might take up to 1h)

> 💡 INFO
>
> If you're unsure with any of the following, don't hesitate to head over to huggingface.co/chat and talk this through with a strong LLM. If you still don't feel confident enough to move ahead: team up with friends, or ask a colleague for
 help. 

Required or recommended:

* Git
* Python
* VS Code
* VS Code Python Extension

In your `> Terminal` app: set up git, which you'll need to download the beyond-chatting course, as [pointed out here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

To set up python, I suggest you install `uv` as described [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), and then install the latest python version following [these instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/). 

To set up VS Code, [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the code editor.

To set up the VS Code Python Extension, follow the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-quick-start) and [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

For a pleasant and less intimidating look, you might consider to install the [catppuccin theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlexDauenhauer.catppuccin-noctis) and the corresponding [icon set](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlexDauenhauer.catppuccin-noctis-icons). 

Now, to finally get beyond-chatting, in your `> Terminal` app `cd` into the folder where you plan to store the beyond-chatting course and clone the repo with `git`:

```shell
cd my-projects
git clone https://github.com/debatelab/beyond-chatting.git
```

This downloads the course in a newly created beyond-chatting folder.

Next:

```shell
cd beyond-chatting
uv venv  # install packages for beyond chatting
```

Then start VS Code and [open the beyond-chatting folder as a workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces/workspaces#_how-do-i-open-a-vs-code-workspace).

🎉 Congrats. You're now ready to start.
